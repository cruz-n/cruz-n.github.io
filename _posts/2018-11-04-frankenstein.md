Naomi Kretzer wrote a short story called “Cat Pictures Please” which is about an AI in a search engine that worked to make some of its users lives better, only of course if they supplied it with cat pictures. This portrayal of artificial intelligence was refreshing in comparison with other stories, movies, and shows about the same thing. Artificial Intelligence is often portrayed in the media as this evil that we need to destroy early on before it takes over the world and punishes humanity for its crimes against them and itself. This is an overly dramatic way to show society’s fear of change and the unknown. The possibility of artificial intelligence becoming more intelligent than humans is frightening because of how powerless it makes people feel but often people assume this technology, rather than actually help people, would abuse that dependence and attack its creators. 

In popular culture, this idea has been reproduced over and over. A common conflict in futuristic movies and shows is that AI becomes more intelligent than their human creators intended and for want of a real, more human,  life, they turn against their creators. The characterization of this technology in this way is obvious in movies like Blade Runner, where the AI is the villain will do anything and kill anyone in order to live beyond the four years his creator gave him. It is apparent even in media where you’re supposed to sympathize with the AI to some extent as in Westworld.

In the sense that in these stories, humans fall prey to their creations, Artificial Intelligence has taken the place of Frankenstein’s Monster. Frankenstein is the story of how Victor Frankenstein was hunted and tortured by a creature of his own uninhibited ambition. The story is filled with many gothic tropes that have since been translated into science fiction. The same eeriness and tragedy that comes with creating life and besting God can be seen in stories about AI.

Most media has taken the stance that humans should be wary of their technological advancements, fearing that one day they will go too far and they will be overcome by their own creations. It is refreshing to see that Kretzer has gotten past the fears of overly developed AI and given this disembodied agent not only power, but compassion. It is impressive for Kretzer to have written something so generally accepted as spooky and wrong in such a positive light.

Not only does the AI have cognitive functions, it has a personality, and a whimsical one at that, with its seemingly silly affinity for cats. Beyond running algorithms for recording patterns in people’s searches and manipulating the information displayed, the AI seeks out specific data and has preferences. As a main motivator, the AI looks for users that share photos of cats and it is on that basis that it chooses who to help. This is a stark contrast to the Frankenstein-esque science fiction portrayal of artificial intelligence.

The commonplace nature of this kind of AI in real life makes it easier to accept this character as something feasibly likeable and good. It is a little disquieting to think about how easy it was for the AI to, not only spy on, but manipulate people. In any other context this fact would have been dramatized and used to make the reader wary of the technology. But the AI itself was written to be kind and compassionate and in turn this detail is cushioned and framed as an asset rather than a downfall to people.

I believe that as AI becomes more prominent in society as aspects of technology and tools for sociability, more stories like this will be written. We are starting to realize that AI is not inherently evil and in fact can be very helpful. People will soon get over the spookiness of this specific thing made by men to resemble men and move on to a more modern Prometheus’s creation.
