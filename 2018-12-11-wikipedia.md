The last event of the year for Reading and Writing in the Digital Age was a Wikipedia workshop, where the intent was to showcase different Wikipedia articles that students and faculty have created. The event ended up being a small gathering of only four students and five faculty members, but nevertheless it was a fun and enlightening time.

Like I said, the event only hosted a few students so there wasn’t too many things we could talk about, with only one Wikipedia entry per student. But this allowed students to talk more in depth about their experiences with Wikipedia and their research for their articles. Although the choices were few, the topics that people worked on their articles varied from Fictitious Entry in fiction, the White Brigade in history, and The Immaculate Conception of Little Dizzle in film. Coming from different kinds of articles, the students’ approach and experiences with Wikipedia varied interestingly. One student created an all new Wikipedia page, while another reorganized it. One student did extensive archival research, while another relied on reviews online. The different experiences allowed for a good conversation about how open and inclusive editing on Wikipedia can be.

The faculty also shared their experiences with Wikipedia. Many of them had worked on Wikipedia before, and often, and had their classes do the same. They had a lot more to say about the process of getting published on Wikipedia and the struggles with editing and regulations from Wikipedia itself. One librarian is a regular wiki-editor who created an entry for Afrofuturism, which gave me echos back to the beginning of the semester where we read Binti. This coincidence really made me feel like the class had gone full circle.

Overall, the experience was a lovely one. I think a lot more people would have come had it been later and they would have enjoyed it as much as I did. This was a really good way to end the year for me, both because it was a way to celebrate all we’d done and because it felt like a natural way to close the class.
